Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- removeCalendarTypes didn't remove anything.
- Verifying widgets, schemas and layouts now check isUserModified()
- If you remove a product but the external method object still existed
  it would be called, and this would fail, and stop the install.
  Now the existance of the script is checked before calling, and a warning
  is printed if it does not exist any longer.
