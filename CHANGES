New features:

- CMFInstaller: getTool now takes a default, and fails if the tool 
  is not found and no default is specified. This gets rid of 
  "NoneType has no attribute errors" when a tool is missing, and 
  instead you get the name of the tool as missing attribute.
- CMFInstaller: New method verifyActionProvider(), to make sure your 
  tool is an action_provider.
Bug fixes:

- Cleaned up some getTool calls.
